_Updated: 20th March, 2021_

## 1. Purpose
A primary goal of Soctor Who is to be inclusive to the largest number of members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our society, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Soctor Who to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all society members:

 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this society.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert committee members, appointed deputies, or relevant university or union staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 - Remember that society event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
 - Refrain from screenshotting or otherwise recording the screen during online meetings and events, unless all participants have been informed screenshots are taking place and have been given ample oppurtunity to opt out.
 
## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within the society:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 - Inappropriate photography or recording.
 - Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 - Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 - Sustained disruption of society events, including talks and presentations.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any attendee or society member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee or society member engages in unacceptable behavior, the committee members, or relevant members of university of union staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the society without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 5. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a committee member, or relevant members of university or union staff as soon as possible.

For incidents that occur outside of a society event you should email the Wellbeing & Social Media Secretary (NAME <email@example.com>).

For incidents that occur during a society event you should either contact a member of the society committee present at the event, or email the Welfare and Inclusivity Officer.

Additionally, committee members are available to help attendees or society members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 6. Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify The University of Nottingham Students' Union with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with the union's existing governing policies. https://su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-change/democracy-and-elections/guidance-and-policy-documents

## 7. Scope
We expect all members and attendees (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all society venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to society business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of society activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of society members.
